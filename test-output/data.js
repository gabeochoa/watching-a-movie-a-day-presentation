I see paintings or drawings in the poorest cottages, in the dirtiest corners. And my mind is driven toward these things with an irresistible force.</i>",

Why didn’t he just use that he wind power on the guy to leave before?\r\n\r\nalso I feel like they should’ve just not showed his face in the beginning and continued shooting it in ways to hide the deaging in the outer world.
